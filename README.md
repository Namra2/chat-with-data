üìñChat with Data
</h1>

An App to interact with Pandas Dataframes using Generative AI (LLMs). This app is built using `streamlit`
as front end and using [`pandasai`](https://github.com/gventuri/pandas-ai) a higher level python wrapper to make dataframes conversational.


## üîß Features
- Upload csv üìÅ(csv) and ask questions about the uploaded Data.
- Ask Questions about the data
- Interact with your data like a Human

## üíª Running Locally

1. Clone the repositoryüìÇ

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amjadraza/chat-with-data.git
```

2. Install dependencies with [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) and activate virtual environmentüî®

```bash
poetry install
poetry shell
```

3. Run the Streamlit serverüöÄ

```bash

streamlit run demo_apps/langchain_app.py 
```

Run App using Docker
--------------------
This project includes `Dockerfile` to run the app in Docker container. In order to optimise the Docker Image
size and building time with cache techniques, I have follow tricks in below Article 
https://medium.com/@albertazzir/blazing-fast-python-docker-builds-with-poetry-a78a66f5aed0

Build the docker container

``docker  build . -t chat-with-data:latest``

To generate Image with `DOCKER_BUILDKIT`, follow below command

```DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build --target=runtime . -t chat-with-data:latest```

1. Run the docker container directly 

``docker run -d --name chat-with-data -p 8000:8000 chat-with-data:latest ``

2. Run the docker container using docker-compose (Recommended)

``docker-compose up``

Deploy App on Streamlit Public Cloud
-------------------------------------

Belo are the steps to deploy a Streamlit App on Streamlit Public Cloud

1. Create a Streamlit App:
Develop your Streamlit app and ensure it's working as expected on your local machine.

2. Push to GitHub:
Upload your Streamlit app code to a GitHub repository if it's not already there. Make sure to include all necessary files and dependencies.
3. Connect to Streamlit Sharing:
Visit Streamlit Sharing and sign in with your GitHub account.

4. Select Repository:
Click on "New App" and select your GitHub repository containing the Streamlit app.

5. Deploy Your App:
Streamlit Sharing will automatically detect your app's settings. Click "Deploy" to start the deployment process. Once complete, you'll receive a public URL to access your Streamlit app.


Deploy App on Google Cloud using Cloud Run (RECOMMENDED)
--------------------------------------------------------
This app can be deployed on Google Cloud using Cloud Run following below steps.

## Prerequisites

Follow below guide on basic Instructions.
[How to deploy Streamlit apps to Google App Engine](https://dev.to/whitphx/how-to-deploy-streamlit-apps-to-google-app-engine-407o)

We added below tow configurations files 

1. `cloudbuild.yaml`: A Configuration file for `gcloud`
2. `.gcloudignore` : Configure the file to ignore file / folders to be uploaded

we are going to use `Dockerfile` to deploy the app using Google Cloud Run.

1. Initialise & Configure the Google Project using Command Prompt

`gcloud app create --project=[YOUR_PROJECT_ID]`

2. Enable Services for the Project

```
gcloud services enable cloudbuild.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable run.googleapis.com
```

3. Create Service Account

```
gcloud iam service-accounts create langchain-app-cr \
    --display-name="langchain-app-cr"

gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding langchain-chat \
    --member="serviceAccount:langchain-app-cr@langchain-chat.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
    --role="roles/run.invoker"

gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding langchain-chat \
    --member="serviceAccount:langchain-app-cr@langchain-chat.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
    --role="roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageConsumer"

gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding langchain-chat \
    --member="serviceAccount:langchain-app-cr@langchain-chat.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
    --role="roles/run.admin"
``` 

4. Generate the Docker

`DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build --target=runtime . -t australia-southeast1-docker.pkg.dev/langchain-chat/clapp/langchain-chainlit-chat-app:latest`

5. Push Image to Google Artifact's Registry

Create the repository with name `clapp`

```
gcloud artifacts repositories create clapp \
    --repository-format=docker \
    --location=australia-southeast1 \
    --description="A Langachain Chainlit App" \
    --async
```

Configure-docker 

`gcloud auth configure-docker australia-southeast1-docker.pkg.dev`

In order to push the `docker-image` to Artifact registry, first create app in the region of choice. 

Check the artifacts locations

`gcloud artifacts locations list`



Once ready, let us push the image to location

`docker push australia-southeast1-docker.pkg.dev/langchain-chat/clapp/langchain-chainlit-chat-app:latest`

6. Deploy using Cloud Run

Once image is pushed to Google Cloud Artifacts Registry. Let us deploy the image.

```
gcloud run deploy langchain-chat-app --image=australia-southeast1-docker.pkg.dev/langchain-chat/clapp/langchain-chainlit-chat-app:latest \
    --region=australia-southeast1 \
    --service-account=langchain-app-cr@langchain-chat.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
    --port=8000
```
